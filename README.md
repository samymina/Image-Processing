# Image-Processing-
This python script is my attempt at learning and using image processing. The images are screenshots from a 5 hour live stream, that displayed a name of a fan in the bottom left corner. The name changed every second. The goal of this program is to help a fan locate when his name was displayed, without having to watch the full 5 hour live stream. The python script uses the OpenCV library to process images, and the pytessaract library to process text on the images. The end result is a list of names that were displayed in the video, which the user can then be searched by the fan to determine when his/her name was displayed.
